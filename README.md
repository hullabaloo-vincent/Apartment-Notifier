# Apartment SMS Notifier
 
<h6>This program uses <a href="www.twilio.com">Twilio</a> for SMS messaging and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/python-craigslist/">python-craigslist</a> to get listings. The program is currently set to my search query.</h6>

I set up this program to run a cron job once a day to send me a text message of the latest Craigslist queries for dog-friendly apartments in the state of Maine.
